# VRP-Scripts
Script can be edited versions of current scripts existing, if so, credits will be added.

Scripts made by [me](https://github.com/Phasfeldt), or developers [@ByHyperion](https://github.com/ByHyperion) will be uploaded in a different folder, apart from the edited ones.

**DISCLAIMER:** Scripts made by me or the developers at ByHyperion, will **not** have full core functionalities, as this would make our own private coding irrelevant for staying unique.
